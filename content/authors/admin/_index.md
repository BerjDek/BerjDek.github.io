# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: 
I am a Researcher and PhD candidate in the Department of Political and Social Sciences at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, where I am a member of the Sociodemography Research Group. My academic journey is deeply rooted in the exploration of collective action and the underlying motivations that drive individuals to participate in citizen-led initiatives. Specifically, my research is focused on dissecting the nuances of engagement in public health interventions and ecological conservation efforts. By employing a multidisciplinary approach, I delve into the realms of design principles, goal orientation, and communication framing to understand how these factors influence participation and commitment to collective goals.
