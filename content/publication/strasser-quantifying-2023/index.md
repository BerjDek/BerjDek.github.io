abstract: Citizen scientists around the world are collecting data with their smartphones,
  performing scientific calculations on their home computers, and analyzing images
  on online platforms. These online citizen science projects are frequently lauded
  for their potential to revolutionize the scope and scale of data collection and
  analysis, improve scientific literacy, and democratize science. Yet, despite the
  attention online citizen science has attracted, it remains unclear how widespread
  public participation is, how it has changed over time, and how it is geographically
  distributed. Importantly, the demographic profile of citizen science participants
  remains uncertain, and thus to what extent their contributions are helping to democratize
  science. Here, we present the largest quantitative study of participation in citizen
  science based on online accounts of more than 14 million participants over two decades.
  We find that the trend of broad rapid growth in online citizen science participation
  observed in the early 2000s has since diverged by mode of participation, with consistent
  growth observed in nature sensing, but a decline seen in crowdsourcing and distributed
  computing. Most citizen science projects, except for nature sensing, are heavily
  dominated by men, and the vast majority of participants, male and female, have a
  background in science. The analysis we present here provides, for the first time,
  a robust ‘baseline’ to describe global trends in online citizen science participation.
  These results highlight current challenges and the future potential of citizen science.
  Beyond presenting our analysis of the collated data, our work identifies multiple
  metrics for robust examination of public participation in science and, more generally,
  online crowds. It also points to the limits of quantitative studies in capturing
  the personal, societal, and historical significance of citizen science.
