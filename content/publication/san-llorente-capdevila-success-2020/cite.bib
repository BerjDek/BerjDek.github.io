 abstract = {Attempts to monitor the quality of freshwater resources on a global scale unveil huge data lacks. Involving citizens in data collection has potential to resolve this lack of water quality data. However, it is widely unclear which factors drive the success of citizen science activities. Based on a systematic literature review of 56 peer-reviewed research articles, we identify three sets of factors for successful citizen science projects in water quality monitoring: (i) attributes of citizens (knowledge and experience in collecting data, awareness of environmental problems, motivation, and socio-economic background of citizens), (ii) attributes of institutions (motivation, type of organization, consistent and adequate funding), and (iii) the interactions between citizens and institutions (supporting structure, communication and feedback). These three sets of factors enable a systematic analysis and design of citizen science projects in the future.},
