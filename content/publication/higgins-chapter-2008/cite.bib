 abstract = {This chapter presents the initial formulation of self-discrepancy theory, which evolved into regulatory-focus theory. It considers how the regulatory focus distinction between promotion is concerned with accomplishment and aspirations and prevention is concerned with safety and responsibilities. The regulatory mode distinction between locomotion is concerned with movement from state to state and assessment is concerned with making comparisons. This could provide a new perspective on cultural differences in trait strength. From this self-regulatory perspective, traits like extraversion or conscientiousness are conceptualized as strategic conduits or channels in the service of promotion, prevention, locomotion, or assessment orientations. That is, rather than themselves reflecting something basic about individuals' motivational predispositions, such traits are considered to provide support for more fundamental and general self-regulatory concerns. Four distinct phases in the course of action were described: deliberation, implementation, goal achievement, and evaluating outcomes of the action.},
