abstract: "This chapter presents the initial formulation of self-discrepancy theory,
  which evolved into regulatory-focus theory. It considers how the regulatory focus
  distinction between promotion is concerned with accomplishment and aspirations and
  prevention is concerned with safety and responsibilities. The regulatory mode distinction
  between locomotion is concerned with movement from state to state and assessment
  is concerned with making comparisons. This could provide a new perspective on cultural
  differences in trait strength. From this self-regulatory perspective, traits like
  extraversion or conscientiousness are conceptualized as strategic conduits or channels
  in the service of promotion, prevention, locomotion, or assessment orientations.
  That is, rather than themselves reflecting something basic about individuals' motivational
  predispositions, such traits are considered to provide support for more fundamental
  and general self-regulatory concerns. Four distinct phases in the course of action
  were described: deliberation, implementation, goal achievement, and evaluating outcomes
  of the action."
