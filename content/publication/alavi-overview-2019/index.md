abstract: Modern smartphones are equipped with various sensors along with on-board
  storage, computing and communication capabilities. Owing to these features, they
  can become an intelligent, scalable, autonomous and potentially cost-free component
  of the next generation civil infrastructure monitoring systems in future smart cities.
  Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest in the deployment of
  smartphone-based monitoring technologies within the civil engineering arena. Overall,
  the smartphone sensing paradigm is still in its infancy, with great promise for
  researchers to rapidly expand its many potential applications. This paper presents
  a comprehensive literature review of smartphone-centric research for the monitoring
  of civil infrastructure systems. The historical deployment of smartphones in major
  areas of civil engineering has been explored. An emphasis is placed on sensing capabilities
  of smartphones and their crowdsourcing power for monitoring several distinct civil
  infrastructure systems. Furthermore, a case study is presented to provide our most
  recent efforts in deployment of smartphones for evaluation of highway pavements
  and challenges ahead. Finally, limitations, challenges and future directions for
  widespread application of smartphone-driven monitoring systems are discussed. The
  survey implies that much research is still required to explore the power of crowdsourced
  smartphone-based measurements, and to branch out into new application domains.
