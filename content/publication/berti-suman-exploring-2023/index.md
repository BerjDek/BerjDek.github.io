abstract: People over the course of history have survived by developing their ability
  to ‘sense’ their environment as an embryonic form of citizen science. With the emergence
  of modern states, governments have assumed responsibility for monitoring the quality
  of the environment, and progressively the practice and role of citizen science has
  changed. This review explores the different manifestations of citizen science over
  time, with a focus on its law and governance dimensions, reading this evolution
  as a critical analysis of the current discourses around citizen science. The evolution
  of citizen science throughout history and its transformation shows certain patterns
  that are highlighted in this article as ‘constant’ features, whereas other features
  are instead interrupted and reversed, and new ones emerge. We thus examined citizen
  science over time by asking what is really new about this phenomenon, focusing on
  constants—permanent features—and turning points—changes in direction. We argue that
  these dynamics are central to understanding the promises and perils of the practice,
  to fully grasping the forms of uninvited, reactive environmental citizen science
  and to scoping foreseeable future scenarios.
