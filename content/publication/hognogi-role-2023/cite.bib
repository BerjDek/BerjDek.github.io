 abstract = {The advancements in digital technologies, especially for mobile apps, enabled simplified data collection methods. Consequently, through Citizen Science, numerous opportunities arose for citizens to become contributors and not just beneficiaries of scientific research. Furthermore, through such engagement, citizens can participate in decision-making processes at different spatial scales, getting closer to the civic aspiration of a digital agora. This paper offers a systematic review of 303 studies on such initiatives to outline the potential of mobile apps in Citizen Science. Based distinctly on their specificities and the needs they address, three content categories were highlighted: a) monitoring tools, b) validation of techniques and methods to improve mobile technologies for Citizen Science, and c) participatory approaches of citizens employing mobile apps. The review also showed a susceptibility of several domains of activity towards Citizen Science, such as monitoring biodiversity and reconnecting people with nature, environmental risk monitoring or improving well-being. The findings highlight future research potential in addressing topics such as new technologies to increase Citizen Science performance and its contributions to Open Science, as well as diversification and enhancement of citizen scientists’ contributions.},
