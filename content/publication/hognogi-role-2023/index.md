abstract: 'The advancements in digital technologies, especially for mobile apps, enabled
  simplified data collection methods. Consequently, through Citizen Science, numerous
  opportunities arose for citizens to become contributors and not just beneficiaries
  of scientific research. Furthermore, through such engagement, citizens can participate
  in decision-making processes at different spatial scales, getting closer to the
  civic aspiration of a digital agora. This paper offers a systematic review of 303
  studies on such initiatives to outline the potential of mobile apps in Citizen Science.
  Based distinctly on their specificities and the needs they address, three content
  categories were highlighted: a) monitoring tools, b) validation of techniques and
  methods to improve mobile technologies for Citizen Science, and c) participatory
  approaches of citizens employing mobile apps. The review also showed a susceptibility
  of several domains of activity towards Citizen Science, such as monitoring biodiversity
  and reconnecting people with nature, environmental risk monitoring or improving
  well-being. The findings highlight future research potential in addressing topics
  such as new technologies to increase Citizen Science performance and its contributions
  to Open Science, as well as diversification and enhancement of citizen scientists’
  contributions.'
