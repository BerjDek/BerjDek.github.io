abstract: One way to improve the value of citizen science data for a specific aim
  is through promoting adaptive sampling, where the marginal value of a citizen science
  observation is dependent on existing data collected to address a specific question.
  Adaptive sampling could increase sampling at places or times—using a dynamic and
  updateable framework—where data are expected to be most informative for a given
  ecological question or conservation goal. We used an experimental approach to test
  whether the participants in a popular Australian citizen science project—FrogID—would
  follow an adaptive sampling protocol aiming to maximize understanding of frog diversity.
  After a year, our results demonstrated that these citizen science participants were
  willing to adopt an adaptive sampling protocol, improving the sampling of biodiversity
  consistent with a specific aim. Such adaptive sampling can increase the value of
  citizen science data for biodiversity research and open up new avenues for citizen
  science project design.
