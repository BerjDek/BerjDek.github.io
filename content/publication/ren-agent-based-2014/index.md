abstract: The design of complex social systems, such as online communities, requires
  the consideration of many parameters, a practice at odds with social science research
  that focuses on the effects of a small set of variables. In this article, we show
  how synthesizing insights from multiple, narrowly focused social science theories
  in an agent-based model helps us understand factors that lead to the success of
  online communities. The agent-based model combines insights from theories related
  to collective effort, information overload, social identity, and interpersonal attraction
  to predict motivations for online community participation. We conducted virtual
  experiments to develop hypotheses around three design decisions about how to orchestrate
  an online community—topical breadth, message volume, and discussion moderation—and
  the trade-offs involved in making these decisions. The simulation experiments suggest
  that broad topics and high message volume can lead to higher member commitment.
  Personalized moderation outperforms other types of moderation in increasing members'
  commitment and contribution, especially in topically broad communities and those
  with high message volume. In comparison, community-level moderation increases commitment
  but not contribution, and only in topically narrow communities. These simulation
  results suggest a critical trade-off between informational and relational benefits.
  This research illustrates that there are many interactions among the design decisions
  that are important to consider; the particulars of the community's goals often determine
  the effectiveness of some decisions. It also demonstrates the value of agent-based
  modeling in synthesizing simple social science theories to describe and prescribe
  behaviors in a complex system, generating novel insights that inform the design
  of online communities.
