abstract: Recognizing that value involves experiencing pleasure or pain is critical
  to understanding the psychology of value. But hedonic experience is not enough.
  I propose that it is also necessary to recognize that strength of engagement can
  contribute to experienced value through its contribution to the experience of motivational
  force--an experience of the intensity of the force of attraction to or repulsion
  from the value target. The subjective pleasure/pain properties of a value target
  influence strength of engagement, but factors separate from the hedonic properties
  of the value target also influence engagement strength and thus contribute to the
  experience of attraction or repulsion. These additional sources of engagement strength
  include opposition to interfering forces, overcoming personal resistance, using
  the right or proper means of goal pursuit, and regulatory fit between the orientation
  and manner of goal pursuit. Implications of the contribution of engagement strength
  to value are discussed for judgment and decision making, persuasion, and emotional
  experiences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)
