abstract: Online citizen science offers a low-cost way to strengthen the infrastructure
  for scientific research and engage members of the public in science. As the sustainability
  of online citizen science projects depends on volunteers who contribute their skills,
  time, and energy, the objective of this study is to investigate effects of motivational
  factors on the quantity and quality of citizen scientists' contribution. Building
  on the social movement participation model, findings from a longitudinal empirical
  study in three different citizen science projects reveal that quantity of contribution
  is determined by collective motives, norm-oriented motives, reputation, and intrinsic
  motives. Contribution quality, on the other hand, is positively affected only by
  collective motives and reputation. We discuss implications for research on the motivation
  for participation in technology-mediated social participation and for the practice
  of citizen science.
