abstract: Context The concept of citizen science (CS) is currently referred to by
  many actors inside and outside science and research. Several descriptions of this
  purportedly new approach of science are often heard in connection with large datasets
  and the possibilities of mobilizing crowds outside science to assists with observations
  and classifications. However, other accounts refer to CS as a way of democratizing
  science, aiding concerned communities in creating data to influence policy and as
  a way of promoting political decision processes involving environment and health.
  Objective In this study we analyse two datasets (N = 1935, N = 633) retrieved from
  the Web of Science (WoS) with the aim of giving a scientometric description of what
  the concept of CS entails. We account for its development over time, and what strands
  of research that has adopted CS and give an assessment of what scientific output
  has been achieved in CS-related projects. To attain this, scientometric methods
  have been combined with qualitative approaches to render more precise search terms.
  Results Results indicate that there are three main focal points of CS. The largest
  is composed of research on biology, conservation and ecology, and utilizes CS mainly
  as a methodology of collecting and classifying data. A second strand of research
  has emerged through geographic information research, where citizens participate
  in the collection of geographic data. Thirdly, there is a line of research relating
  to the social sciences and epidemiology, which studies and facilitates public participation
  in relation to environmental issues and health. In terms of scientific output, the
  largest body of articles are to be found in biology and conservation research. In
  absolute numbers, the amount of publications generated by CS is low (N = 1935),
  but over the past decade a new and very productive line of CS based on digital platforms
  has emerged for the collection and classification of data.
