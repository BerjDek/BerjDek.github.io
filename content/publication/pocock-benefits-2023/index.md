abstract: "The current biodiversity crisis, extinction of experience of nature and
  rising concern about people's well-being and mental health require us to understand
  the benefits of activities supporting people's engagement with nature. We ran a
  1-week randomised controlled experiment to test the impact of nature-focussed activities
  on people's connectedness to nature and well-being. This project, called ‘Nature
  Up Close and Personal: A Wellbeing Experiment’ recruited 500 people who completed
  the pre- and post-participation surveys which included seven psychometric outcome
  measures. People were randomly assigned to one of six groups. Those in non-control
  groups were asked to take part in one 10-min activity five times over 8 days; this
  could be done in any place with nature near to them. The activities were as follows:
  two different citizen science activities, a nature-noticing activity (asking people
  to note three good things in nature: 3GTiN) or a combination of citizen science
  and 3GTiN. Citizen science, 3GTiN and the combination of the two had significant
  positive effects on nature connectedness, happiness, sense of worthwhile life and
  satisfaction with life. 3GTiN (alone and in combination with citizen science) had
  significant positive effects on pro-nature conservation behaviours. All activities
  engaged the pathways to nature connectedness. Compared to 3GTiN, people doing citizen
  science scored lower at engaging with nature through their senses, and feeling calm
  or joyful, but higher for feeling that they made a difference. The combined activity
  engaged the pathways to nature connectedness at least as strongly as the highest
  scoring of citizen science or 3GTiN individually. This shows the potential to intentionally
  design citizen science to enhance the pathways to nature connectedness. Nature-based
  citizen science is more than just a way to gather environmental data: it benefits
  well-being and nature connectedness of participants, and (when in combination with
  noticing nature activities) pro-nature conservation behaviours. It adds to the range
  of activities already proven to enhanced human–nature interactions and nature connectedness.
  Public policy needs to develop a ‘one health’ approach to people's engagement with
  nature, supporting communities to both notice and monitor everyday biodiversity,
  recognising that human and nature's well-being is interdependent. Read the free
