abstract: 'Understanding volunteers’ motivations to participate in Citizen Science
  (CS) projects is essential for these projects’ effective management and success.
  Many studies have investigated citizen scientists’ motivations, but only a few have
  used a theory-based approach to provide a standardized methodology to measure CS
  motivations. The current research aims to take the literature a step further by
  developing and applying a general, standardized, theory-based framework of CS motivation
  and a CS motivation scale (CSMS) that can be used to assess volunteers’ motivations
  across diverse CS projects. The CSMS comprises 58 items corresponding to 15 motivational
  categories. It is grounded in Schwartz’s theory of basic human values, while incorporating
  the wealth of empirical knowledge on citizen scientists’ motivations. We administered
  the scale to three separate samples of either Dutch or Hebrew-speaking participants
  who volunteered for three CS projects. Analysis of participants’ ratings of their
  motivations supported our theoretical framework, showing that 13 of the scale’s
  15 motivational categories fell into 4 higher-order motivations, which correspond
  to Schwartz’s theory of values: openness to change, self-enhancement, continuity
  (conservation), and self-transcendence. Results further provide concrete insights
  into CS participation behavior, showing that certain motivations (including help
  with research, benevolence, and self-direction) were consistently among the most
  important motivators for participation across CS projects. Finally, we found that
  prioritizing certain motivations can also predict participation behavior (e.g.,
  duration of participation and willingness to participate in additional volunteering
  activities). The CSMS is a new tool that can be applied across projects spanning
  diverse domains and populations, advancing and standardizing the growing literature
  on CS motivations.'
