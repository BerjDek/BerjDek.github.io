abstract: This research demonstrates that people's goals associated with regulatory
  focus moderate the effect of message framing on persuasion. The results of 6 experiments
  show that appeals presented in gain frames are more persuasive when the message
  is promotion focused, whereas loss-framed appeals are more persuasive when the message
  is prevention focused. These regulatory focus effects suggesting heightened vigilance
  against negative outcomes and heightened eagerness toward positive outcomes are
  replicated when perceived risk is manipulated. Enhanced processing fluency leading
  to more favorable evaluations in conditions of compatibility appears to underlie
  these effects. The findings underscore the regulatory fit principle that accounts
  for the persuasiveness of message framing effects and highlight how processing fluency
  may contribute to the \"feeling right\" experience when the strategy of goal pursuit
  matches one's goal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)
