abstract: Reported benefits of environmental citizen science include the collection
  of large volumes of data, knowledge and skills gained by participants, local action,
  and policy influence. However, it is unclear how diverse citizen science participants
  are, raising concerns about representativeness of data and whether individual, societal,
  and environmental benefits are evenly distributed. We surveyed 8,220 people representing
  a cross section of the population in Great Britain to ask whether they had participated
  in environmental citizen science, allowing us to examine who is and who is not participating.
  Using logistic regression, we examined relationships between demographic variables,
  and crucially the interactions between these variables, and the likelihood of participation
  and whether participation was repeated. Men were more likely to participate than
  women. People identifying as from white ethnic groups were more likely to participate
  than those identifying as from minority ethnic groups; participation by women from
  minority ethnic groups was particularly low. Participation by those from white ethnic
  groups declined with socio-economic status, but this was not the case for those
  from minority ethnic groups. Participation was highest amongst those in education
  (studying at school, college, or university) and lowest amongst the unemployed.
  We recommend citizen science practitioners carefully consider the aims of projects
  and thus the diversity of participants they wish to attract. We discuss potential
  mechanisms for widening participation, for example, engaging participants through
  third parties already embedded in communities and providing a variety of tasks for
  people with different amounts of time and types of skills to offer. Finally, we
  encourage practitioners to document and publish participant demographics to monitor
  diversity in citizen science.
