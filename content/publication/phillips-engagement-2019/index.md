abstract: To date, most studies of citizen science engagement focus on quantifiable
  measures related to the contribution of data or other output measures. Few studies
  have attempted to qualitatively characterize citizen science engagement across multiple
  projects and from the perspective of the participants. Building on pertinent literature
  and sociocultural learning theories, this study operationalizes engagement in citizen
  science through an analysis of interviews of 72 participants from six different
  environmentally based projects. We document engagement in citizen science through
  an examination of cognitive, affective, social, behavioral, and motivational dimensions.
  We assert that engagement in citizen science is enhanced by acknowledging these
  multiple dimensions and creating opportunities for volunteers to find personal relevance
  in their work with scientists. A Dimensions of Engagement framework is presented
  that can facilitate the innovation of new questions and methodologies for studying
  engagement in citizen science and other forms of informal science education.
