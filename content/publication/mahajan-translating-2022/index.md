abstract: The practice of participatory sensing for environment monitoring has rapidly
  evolved over the years. There has been a steady growth of citizen-based air quality
  monitoring projects that aim to build partnerships, knowledge-sharing platforms,
  awareness, and ultimately resilience to issues related to air quality. Whilst citizen
  science has reshaped air quality research by bringing a fresh perspective on democratizing
  science for the public good, there is little research about how citizen-generated
  data can be used for facilitating and improving evidence-based policymaking. To
  address the problem in a structured manner, we examine the existing literature related
  to citizen science, air quality, and policymaking to understand the existing gaps
  and opportunities. That is followed by a review of major grassroots and collaborative
  citizen science air quality monitoring initiatives in Asia, Africa, Europe, and
  Latin America. We explore the range of citizen science methods and applications
  to understand how they are creating opportunities for dialog between practitioners
  and policymakers, discuss the concerns about citizen-generated data, and see if
  the data is used for policy action. Finally, we propose a methodology for integrating
  data-based evidence into shaping policy. The methodology combines scientific evidence,
  participation, and deliberation to realize the full potential of citizen science
  in air quality monitoring.
