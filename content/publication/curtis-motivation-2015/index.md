abstract: Online citizen science projects have the potential to engage thousands of
  participants with scientific research. A small number of projects such as Foldit
  use an online computer game format. Motivation to participate in Foldit was investigated
  in a group of 37 players using an online survey, semistructured interviews, and
  participant observation. Results suggest that contributing to scientific research
  and an interest in science were among the most important motivations for participation.
  Interaction with others within the community of participants and the intellectual
  challenge of the game were also key for the continuing involvement of this group
  of regular contributors.
