abstract: Background The persuasiveness of nutritional messages varies according to
  individual regulatory focus. However, so far research has focused on the negative
  or positive valence of the message, while we lack research on the differential effectiveness
  of health vs. well-being messages. We tested whether messages centred on negative
  health or well-being outcomes influenced the intention to eat red meat, and whether
  participantsâ€™ predominant regulatory focus moderated this effect. Methods Participants
  (N = 207; 83 males, 124 females; mean age = 24.89, SD = 7.76) completed a questionnaire
  measuring dietary preferences and predominant regulatory focus. They were then presented
  with different versions of a message describing the negative effects of excessive
  red meat consumption on either health or well-being. They rated their involvement
  in the message and intention to eat red meat. Results Participants with a prevalent
  prevention focus showed greater involvement and lower intention to eat red meat
  after reading health messages than after reading well-being messages. No such difference
  was found in participants with a prevalent promotion focus. Conclusions Emphasising
  the avoidance of organic diseases appears to be an effective strategy to involve
  individuals and reduce their intention to eat red meat, especially when they have
  a predominant prevention focus.
