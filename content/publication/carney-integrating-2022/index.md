abstract: Mosquito-borne diseases continue to ravage humankind with textgreater700
  million infections and nearly one million deaths every year. Yet only a small percentage
  of the textgreater3500 mosquito species transmit diseases, necessitating both extensive
  surveillance and precise identification. Unfortunately, such efforts are costly,
  time-consuming, and require entomological expertise. As envisioned by the Global
  Mosquito Alert Consortium, citizen science can provide a scalable solution. However,
  disparate data standards across existing platforms have thus far precluded truly
  global integration. Here, utilizing Open Geospatial Consortium standards, we harmonized
  four data streams from three established mobile apps—Mosquito Alert, iNaturalist,
  and GLOBE Observer’s Mosquito Habitat Mapper and Land Cover—to facilitate interoperability
  and utility for researchers, mosquito control personnel, and policymakers. We also
  launched coordinated media campaigns that generated unprecedented numbers and types
  of observations, including successfully capturing the first images of targeted invasive
  and vector species. Additionally, we leveraged pooled image data to develop a toolset
  of artificial intelligence algorithms for future deployment in taxonomic and anatomical
  identification. Ultimately, by harnessing the combined powers of citizen science
  and artificial intelligence, we establish a next-generation surveillance framework
  to serve as a united front to combat the ongoing threat of mosquito-borne diseases
  worldwide.
