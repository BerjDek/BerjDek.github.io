abstract: Regulatory focus theory (e.g., Higgins, 1997) presented a differentiation
  between promotion orientation, focused on growth and advancement, and prevention
  orientation, focused on safety and security. Cross-culture differences in these
  systems generally show that that collectivist, Eastern cultures (mostly East-Asian
  cultures) are considered as prevention oriented whereas Western cultures are considered
  as promotion oriented. Two main claims that contribute to the refinement of the
  relations between culture and regulatory foci will be presented. The first refinement
  pertains to the relations between individualism-collectivism and regulatory foci
  on base of the vertical-horizontal distinction, showing that vertical collectivism
  is especially relevant to regulatory foci. The second claim challenges the traditional
  notion of uni-dimensional mapping of cultures on the prevention-promotion continuum.
  Cultural groups from Hong Kong and Israel were compared in their typical levels
  of regulatory foci and in reaction to different incentive framing (gain/non-gain
  vs non-loss/ loss). The findings revealed a culture (Hong Kong) that is oriented
  to both, prevention and promotion, at least regarding achievement.
