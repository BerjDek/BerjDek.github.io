abstract: People approach pleasure and avoid pain. To discover the true nature of
  approach–avoidance motivation, psychologists need to move beyond this hedonic principle
  to the principles that underlie the different ways that it operates. One such principle
  is regulatory focus, which distinguishes self-regulation with a promotion focus
  (accomplishments and aspirations) from self-regulation with a prevention focus (safety
  and responsibilities). This principle is used to reconsider the fundamental nature
  of approach–avoidance, expectancy–value relations, and emotional and evaluative
  sensitivities. Both types of regulatory focus are applied to phenomena that have
  been treated in terms of either promotion (e.g., well-being) or prevention (e.g.,
  cognitive dissonance). Then, regulatory focus is distinguished from regulatory anticipation
  and regulatory reference, 2 other principles underlying the different ways that
  people approach pleasure and avoid pain. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA,
