abstract: Worldwide, citizen scientists help to map the distribution of native and
  introduced mosquito species in a variety of programs, contributing to environmental
  research and management decisions. Participant background, behavior, and engagement
  may vary depending on the project design, especially between those using digital
  apps and those using physical samples, which in turn may impact the quality and
  representativeness of the data collected. During the analysis of the responses to
  a survey directed at citizen scientists participating in  a digital and an analog
  program, we found significant differences in the respondents’ demographic backgrounds.
  Diverse participant motivations and varying sentiments towards mosquitoes were observed,
  indicating differing susceptibility in response to the program messages. The results
  can be translated into recommendations to further strengthen the appeal of citizen
  science projects and to promote and sustain public engagement in environmental research.
