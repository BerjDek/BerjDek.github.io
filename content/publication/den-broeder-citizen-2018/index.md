abstract: Community engagement in public health policy is easier said than done. One
  reason is that public health policy is produced in a complex process resulting in
  policies that may appear not to link up to citizen perspectives. We therefore address
  the central question as to whether citizen engagement in knowledge production could
  enable inclusive health policy making. Building on non-health work fields, we describe
  different types of citizen engagement in scientific research, or ‘Citizen Science’.
  We describe the challenges that Citizen Science poses for public health, and how
  these could be addressed. Despite these challenges, we expect that Citizen Science
  or similar approaches such as participatory action research and ‘popular epidemiology’
  may yield better knowledge, empowered communities, and improved community health.
  We provide a draft framework to enable evaluation of Citizen Science in practice,
  consisting of a descriptive typology of different kinds of Citizen Science and a
  causal framework that shows how Citizen Science in public health might benefit both
  the knowledge produced as well as the ‘Citizen Scientists’ as active participants.
