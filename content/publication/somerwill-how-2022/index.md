abstract: The effects of citizen science are wide ranging, influencing science, society,
  the economy, the environment, as well as individual participants. However, in many
  citizen science projects, impact evaluation is still overly simplistic. This is
  particularly the case when assessing the impact of participation in citizen science
  on the environmental attitudes, behaviour and knowledge of citizen scientists. In
  an attempt to bridge the gap between the state of the art in relevant scientific
  fields and citizen science, this systematic literature review identified best practices
  and approaches in the field of environmental psychology for measuring environmental
  attitudes, behaviour and knowledge. From the literature, five relevant and validated
  approaches were identified that can be used to measure changes in attitudes, behaviour
  and knowledge in citizen science projects. This would allow for improved understanding
  of the impacts of citizen science, as well as for improved project evaluation as
  a whole.
