abstract: "Citizen science has proven to be a valuable tool for biodiversity conservation.
  However, to maximize the conservation benefits of citizen science programs, researchers
  and practitioners would gain from a better understanding of project volunteers and
  what drives them to participate. We examined the diverse motivations of volunteers
  (n = 3041) participating in Audubon's Christmas Bird Count, one of the world's oldest
  ecological monitoring citizen (or community) science projects. Principal axis factor
  analysis along a 16-item scale revealed six distinct intrinsic and extrinsic motivational
  constructs: science and conservation, outdoor recreation and discovery, commitment
  and tradition, social interaction, classic birding, and personal accomplishment.
  Most participants reported multiple motivations, but 40% indicated contribution
  to science and conservation was their primary reason for initially engaging with
  the project. As project participation continued, science and conservation-related
  motives became even more important (with 55% listing as primary continuing motivation).
  Regression analyses showed motivational orientations varied by socio-demographic
  attributes and levels/type of project participation. For example, social interaction
  and tradition were more important to aspiring project leaders than casual observers.
  Results highlight insights into deepening project engagement and recruiting and
  retaining citizen scientists. Adapted and applied across different contexts, our
  instrument and motivational constructs could help to facilitate volunteer management
  and enhance citizen science's capacity to advance biodiversity conservation goals."
