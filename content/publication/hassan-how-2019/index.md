abstract: With the increasing provenance of hedonic and social information systems,
  systems are observed to employ other forms of feedback and design than purely informational
  in order to increase user engagement and motivation. Three principle classes of
  motivational design pursuing user engagement have become increasingly established;
  gamification, quantified-self and social networking. This study investigates how
  the perceived prominence of these three design classes in users’ use of information
  system facilitate experiences of affective, informational and social feedback as
  well as user’s perceived benefits from a system and their continued use intentions.
  We employ survey data (N = 167) gathered from users of HeiaHeia; an exercise encouragement
  system that employs features belonging to the three design classes. The results
  indicate that gamification is positively associated with experiences of affective
  feedback, quantified-self with experiences of both affective and informational feedback
  and social networking with experiences of social feedback. Experiences of affective
  feedback are further strongly associated with user perceived benefits and continued
  use intentions, whereas experiences of informational feedback are only associated
  with continued use intentions. Experiences of social feedback had no significant
  relationship with neither. The findings provide practical insights into how systems
  can be designed to facilitate different types of feedback that increases users’
  engagement, benefits and intentions to continue the use of a system.
