abstract: Citizen science is frequently cited as a successful approach for increasing
  public engagement with environmental issues, but this requires a purposeful design
  that is inclusive of, and responsive to, diverse interests. This paper explores
  the mechanisms for improving participant and public engagement with citizen science
  results, using the New Zealand Garden Bird Survey (NZGBS) as a case study. It investigates
  how citizen science can apply democratic processes to be more responsive, while
  drawing on insights from behaviour change frameworks to facilitate a purposeful
  design. By inviting NZGBS participants to select, inform and peer review the design
  and promotion of new resources, our goal was to embed their values, opinions and
  perspectives into the developments. This not only empowered 15,844 respondents to
  contribute directly to the citizen science initiative's governance over 6 years,
  but also made it more engaging and useful to them and the wider public. New resources
  were designed to create a sense of collective action, making them attractive, easy
  to understand and promote on multiple media channels, aiming to reach a wider range
  of audiences. By diversifying and refining our communication strategy, we successfully
  enhanced the level and nature of engagement with the resources. The number and diversity
  of NZGBS participants also increased to involve people from a wider range of backgrounds
  and roles, ethnicities and ages. By applying a democratic process, we demonstrate
  how citizen scientist perspectives were elevated, to offset and mitigate the influence
  of institutional powers, which can dominate and shape engagement processes. We also
  highlight the value of behaviour change frameworks for understanding how choice
  architecture, social networks and key influencers, and their complex interactions
  can create the enabling environment required for engagement. A free Plain Language
