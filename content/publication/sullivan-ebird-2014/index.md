abstract: 'Citizen-science projects engage volunteers to gather or process data to
  address scientific questions. But citizen-science projects vary in their ability
  to contribute usefully for science, conservation, or public policy. eBird has evolved
  from a basic citizen-science project into a collective enterprise, taking a novel
  approach to citizen science by developing cooperative partnerships among experts
  in a wide range of fields: population and distributions, conservation biologists,
  quantitative ecologists, statisticians, computer scientists, GIS and informatics
  specialists, application developers, and data administrators. The goal is to increase
  data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify
  and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection
  of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. Advances at the
  interface among ecology, statistics, and computer science allow us to create new
  species distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad spatial
  and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution. eBird data are openly available
  and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government
  agencies, land managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use community
  helps identify development priorities. As a result, eBird has become a major source
  of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions,
  and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats.'
