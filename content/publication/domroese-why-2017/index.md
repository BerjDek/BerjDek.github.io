abstract: The benefits of citizen science to conservation, science, and socio-ecological
  systems as well as to participants themselves are increasingly recognized and valued,
  yet what motivates volunteers remains little studied and poorly understood. To better
  understand citizen scientists' motivations and how they benefit from their participation,
  we surveyed volunteers in the Great Pollinator Project, a conservation-related project
  in New York City. We conducted pre- and post-season surveys and focus group sessions
  to find out who the active volunteers were, their reasons for joining, what benefits
  of participation they experienced, as well as challenges they encountered collecting
  and submitting data. In comparison with results of several surveys of environmental
  and conservation volunteers, we found a similar range of motivators. However, while
  studies of motivations of environmental volunteers have indicated helping the environment
  as the strongest factor, interest in learning about bees—the subject of the study—was
  the top motivation of our citizen science volunteers. Helping or contributing to
  science was the second most cited motivator for participants in the project. Less
  strong were outdoor/recreation and social factors. We discuss some of the steps
  we took in response to participants' feedback in order to improve volunteer recruitment
  and retention. We also make additional recommendations for project design and research
  to enhance understanding of volunteer motivations, which will benefit volunteers
  themselves as well as strengthen their contribution to conservation outcomes.
