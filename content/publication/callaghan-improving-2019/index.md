abstract: 'Citizen science is mainstream: millions of people contribute data to a
  growing array of citizen science projects annually, forming massive datasets that
  will drive research for years to come. Many citizen science projects implement a
  “leaderboard” framework, ranking the contributions based on number of records or
  species, encouraging further participation. But is every data point equally “valuable?”
  Citizen scientists collect data with distinct spatial and temporal biases, leading
  to unfortunate gaps and redundancies, which create statistical and informational
  problems for downstream analyses. Up to this point, the haphazard structure of the
  data has been seen as an unfortunate but unchangeable aspect of citizen science
  data. However, we argue here that this issue can actually be addressed: we provide
  a very simple, tractable framework that could be adapted by broadscale citizen science
  projects to allow citizen scientists to optimize the marginal value of their efforts,
  increasing the overall collective knowledge.'
