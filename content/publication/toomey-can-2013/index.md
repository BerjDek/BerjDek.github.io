abstract: Citizen science—the partnering of scientists with members of the public
  to do research—is increasingly utilized in environmental research, having been credited
  with enabling studies that would otherwise be cost-prohibitive while promoting scientific
  literacy and empowering and engaging participants in conservation. Although the
  value of citizen-generated data for scientific purposes is increasingly accepted,
  and there is a growing recognition of the role of citizen science in developing
  science literacy, there has been little investigation of its link to conservation
  outcomes—particularly in terms of volunteers' further engagement in conservation.
  This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between participation in citizen
  science and conservation attitude and behavior changes, and looks at the relevance
  of theoretical models to shed light on possible drivers of such changes. We discuss
  two citizen science projects in the New York metropolitan area—the Great Pollinator
  Project and the Earthwatch Coyote Project—as illustrations of the impact of citizen
  science on attitudes and behaviors as perceived by participants. We offer recommendations
  for further research on facilitating conservation outcomes through citizen science.
