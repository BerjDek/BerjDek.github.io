abstract: Citizen science is a rapidly growing field with expanding legitimacy. Often
  seen as a cluster of activities under a larger umbrella of concepts, including ‘open
  science’ and ‘open innovation’, citizen science expands public participation in
  science and supports alternative models of knowledge production. This includes strengthening
  scientific research by engaging with a variety of topics and information sources,
  and fostering cross- or trans-disciplinary knowledge production. Citizen science
  can expand stakeholder participation and introduce new perspectives and information
  as well as new partnerships. Many projects are opening up cutting-edge areas of
  science, such as gene editing and synthetic biology, to new
