abstract: Two studies examined the impact of chronic and situational self-regulatory
  mechanisms on cognitive test performance. In both studies, test performance was
  enhanced when situationally induced regulatory mechanisms matched the chronic self-regulatory
  focus of the test taker. These results support the regulatory fit hypothesis put
  forward in regulatory focus theory and point to the importance of compatibility
  between chronic and situationally induced self-regulatory states when it comes to
  cognitive test performance. Copyright Â© 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
