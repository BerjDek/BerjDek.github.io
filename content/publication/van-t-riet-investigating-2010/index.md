abstract: Health-promoting messages can be framed in terms of the gains associated
  with healthy behaviour or the losses associated with unhealthy behaviour. It has
  been argued that gain-framed messages promoting physical activity (PA) are more
  effective than loss-framed messages, but empirical findings are inconsistent. Also,
  no previous studies investigated the effects of gain- and loss-framed messages in
  the context of a computer-tailored PA intervention. In this study, we provided participants
  with computer-generated tailored feedback concerning their PA levels. In total,
  787 participants entered in the study, of whom 299 completed all measures at a 3-month
  follow-up. We investigated whether gain- and loss-framed messages promoting PA affected
  information acceptance, attitude, intention and behaviour differently. The results
  showed that gain-framed messages resulted in stronger intentions to be physically
  active than loss-framed messages. This did not result in a significant increase
  in actual PA, however, as measured by a 3-month follow-up assessment. For information
  acceptance and attitude, a non-significant advantage of gain-framed messages was
  found. All effects had small effect sizes. Thus, whereas gain-framed information
  might be more persuasive than loss-framed information when it comes to promoting
  PA, the differences between gain- and loss-framed messages are likely to be small.
