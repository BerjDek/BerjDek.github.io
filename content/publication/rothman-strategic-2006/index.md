abstract: Message framing provides a theoretically grounded approach to the development
  of effective health messages. In this study, we review the state of research and
  theory on message framing (Rothman &amp; Salovey, 1997), and how it can inform efforts
  to enhance health practices throughout the cancer care continuum. Gain-framed appeals
  are more effective when targeting behaviors that prevent the onset of disease, whereas
  loss-framed appeals are more effective when targeting behaviors that detect the
  presence of a disease. In light of these findings, we consider how message frames
  may affect other types of health behaviors and identify the need to understand better
  the processes that shape how people construe health behaviors.
