abstract: Where does value come from? I propose a new answer to this classic question.
  People experience regulatory fit when the manner of their engagement in an activity
  sustains their goal orientation or interests regarding that activity. When there
  is fit, people engage more strongly in what they are doing and “feel right” about
  it. Fit influences the strength of value experiences—how good or how bad one feels
  about something—independently of the pleasure and pain experiences that are associated
  with outcomes. It uniquely contributes to people's experience of the value of things.
  Fit is shown to influence judgments and decision making, attitude and behavior change,
  and task performance.
