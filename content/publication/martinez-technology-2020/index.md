abstract: The 2016â€“2018National Invasive Species Council (NISC) Management Plan and
  Executive Order 13751 call for US federal agencies to foster technology development
  and application to address invasive species and their impacts. This paper complements
  and draws on an Innovation Summit, review of advanced biotechnologies applicable
  to invasive species management, and a survey of federal agencies that respond to
  these high-level directives. We provide an assessment of federal government capacities
  for the early detection of and rapid response to invasive species (EDRR) through
  advances in technology application; examples of emerging technologies for the detection,
  identification, reporting, and response to invasive species; and guidance for fostering
  further advancements in applicable technologies. Throughout the paper, we provide
  examples of how federal agencies are applying technologies to improve programmatic
  effectiveness and cost-efficiencies. We also highlight the outstanding technology-related
  needs identified by federal agencies to overcome barriers to enacting EDRR. Examples
  include improvements in research facility infrastructure, data mobilization across
  a wide range of invasive species parameters (from genetic to landscape scales),
  promotion of and support for filling key gaps in technological capacity (e.g., portable,
  field-ready devices with automated capacities), and greater investments in technology
  prizes and challenge competitions.
