abstract: Community and citizen science on climate change-influenced topics offers
  a way for participants to actively engage in understanding the changes and documenting
  the impacts. As in broader climate change education, a focus on the negative impacts
  can often leave participants feeling a sense of powerlessness. In large scale projects
  where participation is primarily limited to data collection, it is often difficult
  for volunteers to see how the data can inform decision making that can help create
  a positive future. In this paper, we propose and test a method of linking community
  and citizen science engagement to thinking about and planning for the future through
  scenarios story development using the data collected by the volunteers. We used
  a youth focused wild berry monitoring program that spanned urban and rural Alaska
  to test this method across diverse age levels and learning settings. Using qualitative
  analysis of educator interviews and youth work samples, we found that using a scenario
  stories development mini-workshop allowed the youth to use their own data and the
  data from other sites to imagine the future and possible actions to sustain berry
  resources for their communities. This process allowed youth to exercise key cognitive
  skills for sustainability, including systems thinking, futures thinking, and strategic
  thinking. The analysis suggested that youth would benefit from further practicing
  the skill of envisioning oneself as an agent of change in the environment. Educators
  valued working with lead scientists on the project and the experience for youth
  to participate in the interdisciplinary program. They also identified the combination
  of the berry data collection, analysis and scenarios stories activities as a teaching
  practice that allowed the youth to situate their citizen science participation in
  a personal, local and cultural context. The majority of the youth groups pursued
  some level of stewardship action following the activity. The most common actions
  included collecting additional years of berry data, communicating results to a broader
  community, and joining other community and citizen science projects. A few groups
  actually pursued solutions illustrated in the scenario stories. The pairing of community
  and citizen science with scenario stories development provides a promising method
  to connect data to action for a sustainable and resilient future.
