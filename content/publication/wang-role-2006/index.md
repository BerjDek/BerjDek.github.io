abstract: The authors examine how consumers' regulatory focus affects their information
  search behavior and decision-making process. The results show that uninvolved research
  participants rely on their regulatory focus as a filter to process information selectively.
  Participants paid more attention to and based their product evaluation on product
  information that is relevant to their regulatory concerns, but only when they were
  not motivated to process information. This regulatory fit effect on evaluation seems
  to be driven by the perceptual salience of fit versus nonfit information and is
  more consistent with heuristic than with systematic processing of information.
