abstract: 'Citizen science (CS) aims primarily to create a new scientific culture
  able to improve upon the triple interaction between science, society, and policy
  in the dual pursuit of more democratic research and decision-making informed by
  sound evidence. It is both an aim and an enabler of open science (OS), to which
  it contributes by involving citizens in research and encouraging participation in
  the generation of new knowledge. This study analyses scientific output on CS using
  bibliometric techniques and Web of Science (WoS) data. Co-occurrence maps are formulated
  to define subject clusters as background for an analysis of the impact of each on
  social media. Four clusters are identified: HEALTH, BIO, GEO and PUBLIC. The profiles
  for the four clusters are observed to be fairly similar, although BIO and HEALTH
  are mentioned more frequently in blogposts and tweets and BIO and PUBLIC in Facebook
  and newsfeeds. The findings also show that output in the area has grown since 2010,
  with a larger proportion of papers (66%) mentioned in social media than reported
  in other studies. The percentage of open access documents (30.7%) is likewise higher
  than the overall mean for all areas.'
