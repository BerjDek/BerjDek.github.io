abstract: Citizen science initiatives encourage volunteer participants to collect
  and interpret data and contribute to formal scientific projects. The growth of virtual
  citizen science (VCS), facilitated through websites and mobile applications since
  the mid-2000s, has been driven by a combination of software innovations and mobile
  technologies, growing scientific data flows without commensurate increases in resources
  to handle them, and the desire of internet-connected participants to contribute
  to collective outputs. However, the increasing availability of internet-based activities
  requires individual VCS projects to compete for the attention of volunteers and
  promote their long-term retention. We examined program and platform design principles
  that might allow VCS initiatives to compete more effectively for volunteers, increase
  productivity of project participants, and retain contributors over time. We surveyed
  key personnel engaged in managing a sample of VCS projects to identify the principles
  and practices they pursued for these purposes and led a team in a heuristic evaluation
  of volunteer engagement, website or application usability, and participant retention.
  We received 40 completed survey responses (33% response rate) and completed a heuristic
  evaluation of 20 VCS program sites. The majority of the VCS programs focused on
  scientific outcomes, whereas the educational and social benefits of program participation,
  variables that are consistently ranked as important for volunteer engagement and
  retention, were incidental. Evaluators indicated usability, across most of the VCS
  program sites, was higher and less variable than the ratings for participant engagement
  and retention. In the context of growing competition for the attention of internet
  volunteers, increased attention to the motivations of virtual citizen scientists
  may help VCS programs sustain the necessary engagement and retention of their volunteers.
