abstract: Citizen science has expanded rapidly over the past decades. Yet, defining
  citizen science and its boundaries remained a challenge, and this is reflected in
  the literature—for example in the proliferation of typologies and definitions. There
  is a need for identifying areas of agreement and disagreement within the citizen
  science practitioners community on what should be considered as citizen science
  activity. This paper describes the development and results of a survey that examined
  this issue, through the use of vignettes—short case descriptions that describe an
  activity, while asking the respondents to rate the activity on a scale from ‘not
  citizen science’ (0%) to ‘citizen science’ (100%). The survey included 50 vignettes,
  of which five were developed as clear cases of not-citizen science activities, five
  as widely accepted citizen science activities and the others addressing 10 factors
  and 61 sub-factors that can lead to controversy about an activity. The survey has
  attracted 333 respondents, who provided over 5100 ratings. The analysis demonstrates
  the plurality of understanding of what citizen science is and calls for an open
  understanding of what activities are included in the field.
