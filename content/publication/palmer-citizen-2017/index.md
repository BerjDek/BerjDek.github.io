abstract: Recent outbreaks of Zika, chikungunya and dengue highlight the importance
  of better understanding the spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes across multiple
  spatio-temporal scales. Traditional surveillance tools are limited by jurisdictional
  boundaries and cost constraints. Here we show how a scalable citizen science system
  can solve this problem by combining citizen scientists’ observations with expert
  validation and correcting for sampling effort. Our system provides accurate early
  warning information about the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) invasion in
  Spain, well beyond that available from traditional methods, and vital for public
  health services. It also provides estimates of tiger mosquito risk comparable to
  those from traditional methods but more directly related to the human–mosquito encounters
  that are relevant for epidemiological modelling and scalable enough to cover the
  entire country. These results illustrate how powerful public participation in science
  can be and suggest citizen science is positioned to revolutionize mosquito-borne
  disease surveillance worldwide.
