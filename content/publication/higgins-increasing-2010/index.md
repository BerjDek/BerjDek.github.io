abstract: What makes people’s interest in doing an activity increase or decrease?
  Regulatory fit theory (E. T. Higgins, 2000) provides a new perspective on this classic
  issue by emphasizing the relation between people’s activity orientation, such as
  thinking of an activity as fun, and the manner of activity engagement that the surrounding
  situation supports. These situational factors include whether a reward for good
  performance, expected (Study 1) or unexpected (Study 2), is experienced as enjoyable
  or as serious and whether the free-choice period that measures interest in the activity
  is experienced as enjoyable or as serious (Study 3). Studies 1–3 found that participants
  were more likely to do a fun activity again when these situational factors supported
  a manner of doing the activity that fit the fun orientation—a reward or free-choice
  period framed as enjoyable. This effect was not because interest in doing an activity
  again is simply greater in an enjoyable than a serious surrounding situation because
  it did not occur, and even reversed, when the activity orientation was important
  rather than fun, where now a serious manner of engagement provides the fit (Study
  4a and 4b). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
