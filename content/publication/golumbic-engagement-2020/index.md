abstract: The rise of citizen science in the past decade has brought many opportunities
  for scientists and publics alongside many challenges and questions regarding best
  practices. These include questions regarding public engagement, project design and
  measures of success. The aim of this study is to better understand what makes citizen
  science projects scientifically successful, and highlight what can be learned and
  implemented in future project design. We focus on scientifically productive projects
  as a success measure that can encourage greater scientistsâ€™ involvement in citizen
  science, and analyze five of these projects for factors that contribute to their
  success. We found that although all projects have strong scientific goals, they
  all have additional strong emphases on communication and social practices, providing
  a good user experience and generating motivation and empowerment. We provide five
  heuristics for the future design of citizen science projects, which focus on engagement
  and communication features which we believe are important for citizen science project
  success.
