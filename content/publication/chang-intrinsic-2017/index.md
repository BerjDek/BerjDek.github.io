abstract: This study predicts that the intrinsic (creative personality) and extrinsic
  motivators (transformational leadership) reinforce employee creativity and job performance
  in the hospitality industry. More importantly, the positive moderating effects of
  organizational regulatory focus (promotion and prevention) on employee creativity
  are included in proposed model. To test the mode, data (339 employees and 72 supervisors)
  was collected from 62 Taiwan international hotels in the summer of 2014. A confirmatory
  factor analysis (CFA) and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) were conducted to examine
  measurement model and hypotheses. The HLM results confirmed the effects of individual-level
  factors. However, an organizational promotion focus only enhances the extrinsic
  creative motivator. The intrinsic creative motivator was reinforced by an organizational
  prevention focus. The research findings suggest that hospitality managers should
  consider both individual- and organizational-level factors simultaneously. Indeed,
  the organizational goals could be set depending on the features of the department.
  Further discussions and implications are elucidated.
