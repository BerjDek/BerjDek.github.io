abstract: Citizen science models of public participation in scientific research represent
  a growing area of opportunity for health and biomedical research, as well as new
  impetus for more collaborative forms of engagement in large-scale research. However,
  this also surfaces a variety of ethical issues that both fall outside of and build
  upon the standard human subjects concerns in bioethics. This article provides background
  on citizen science, examples of current projects in the field, and discussion of
  established and emerging ethical issues for citizen science in health and biomedical
  research.
