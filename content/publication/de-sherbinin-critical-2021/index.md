abstract: Citizen science is an important vehicle for democratizing science and promoting
  the goal of universal and equitable access to scientific data and information. Data
  generated by citizen science groups have become an increasingly important source
  for scientists, applied users and those pursuing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
  Development. Citizen science data are used extensively in studies of biodiversity
  and pollution; crowdsourced data are being used by UN operational agencies for humanitarian
  activities; and citizen scientists are providing data relevant to monitoring the
  sustainable development goals (SDGs). This article provides an International Science
  Council (ISC) perspective on citizen science data generating activities in support
  of the 2030 Agenda and on needed improvements to the citizen science community's
  data stewardship practices for the benefit of science and society by presenting
  results of research undertaken by an ISC-sponsored Task Group.
