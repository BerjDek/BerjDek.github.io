abstract: This article provides an analysis of theories and methodologies that have
  been applied in citizen science research. This study suggests a significant contribution
  of citizen science to various disciplines as well as overall science education,
  literacy, and development. A solid theoretical grounding of citizen science research,
  coupled with application of pertinent emergent theories to various processes associated
  with scientific inquiry and discovery, suggests the disciplinary traits and unique
  contributions. This study proposes that the current pace of citizen science research,
  empowered by ordinary citizens as well as technological affordances, provides solid
  evidence to warrant further development of citizen science as a unique discipline
  that can strengthen and democratize scientific inquiry.
