abstract: Participation in conservation citizen science projects is growing rapidly
  and approaches to project design are diversifying. There has been a recent shift
  towards projects characterised by contributors collecting data in isolation and
  submitting findings online, with little training or opportunities for direct social
  interaction with other citizen scientists. While research is emerging on developing
  citizen science projects by optimising technological modalities, little consideration
  has been given to understanding what motivates individuals to voluntarily contribute
  data. Here, we use the Volunteer Functions Inventory, combined with open-ended questions,
  to demonstrate that the two strongest motivations underpinning participation, for
  both individuals who contribute data systematically (regularly; n = 177) and opportunistically
  (ad hoc basis; n = 218), are ‘Values’ and ‘Understanding’. People take part in such
  projects because they have an intrinsic value for the environment and want to support
  research efforts (representing ‘Values’), as well as wanting to learn and gain knowledge
  (signifying ‘Understanding’). Unlike more traditional citizen science projects that
  involve specific training and considerable time investments, contributors to these
  newer types of project are not motivated by the potential to develop their career
  or opportunities for social interaction. The person-level characteristics of contributors
  considered in this study did not reliably forecast levels of motivation, suggesting
  that predicting high levels of motivation is inherently more complex than is often
  speculated. We recommend avenues for future research that may further enhance our
  understanding of contributor motivations and the characteristics that may underpin
  levels of motivation.
