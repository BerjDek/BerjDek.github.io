abstract: Over the past decade, citizen science has experienced growth and popularity
  as a scientific practice and as a new form of stakeholder engagement and public
  participation in science or in the generation of new knowledge. One of the key requirements
  for realising the potential of citizen science is evidence and demonstration of
  its impact and value. Yet the actual changes resulting from citizen science interventions
  are often assumed, ignored or speculated about. Based on a systematic review of
  77 publications, combined with empirical insights from 10 past and ongoing projects
  in the field of citizen science, this paper presents guidelines for a consolidated
  Citizen Science Impact Assessment framework to help overcome the dispersion of approaches
  in assessing citizen science impacts; this comprehensive framework enhances the
  ease and consistency with which impacts can be captured, as well as the comparability
  of evolving results across projects. Our review is framed according to five distinct,
  yet interlinked, impact domains (society, economy, environment, science and technology,
  and governance). Existing citizen science impact assessment approaches provide assessment
  guidelines unevenly across the five impact domains, and with only a small number
  providing concrete indicator-level conceptualisations. The analysis of the results
  generates a number of salient insights which we combine in a set of guiding principles
  for a consolidated impact assessment framework for citizen science initiatives.
  These guiding principles pertain to the purpose of citizen science impact assessments,
  the conceptualisation of data collection methods and information sources, the distinction
  between relative versus absolute impact, the comparison of impact assessment results
  across citizen science projects, and the incremental refinement of the organising
  framework over time.
