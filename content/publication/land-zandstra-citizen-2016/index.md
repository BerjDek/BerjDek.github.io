abstract: Citizen science provides researchers means to gather or analyse large datasets.
  At the same time, citizen science projects offer an opportunity for non-scientists
  to be part of and learn from the scientific process. In the Dutch iSPEX project,
  a large number of citizens turned their smartphones into actual measurement devices
  to measure aerosols. This study examined participants’ motivation and perceived
  learning impacts of this unique project. Most respondents joined iSPEX because they
  wanted to contribute to the scientific goals of the project or because they were
  interested in the project topics (health and environmental impact of aerosols).
  In terms of learning impact, respondents reported a gain in knowledge about citizen
  science and the topics of the project. However, many respondents had an incomplete
  understanding of the science behind the project, possibly caused by the complexity
  of the measurements.
